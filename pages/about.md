<h1 class="mx-auto" style="font-family:Courgette;">{{ page.title }}</h1>

I'm Jose Carlos. I was born in beautiful Barcelona, Spain.

Since early childhood, I always enjoyed finding out how things work, and somehow, I still do it these days.

After finishing university and a few years of experience I moved to Vienna (Austria) with my girlfriend.
I always wanted to live abroad. I had no specific plans. After 5 wonderful years (including our wedding)
in which we met wonderful people, we decided to move to Japan looking for new challenges.

We always had an interest in Japanese culture. And even more, after two travels we did between 2015 and 2017.
Nowadays, we live in Tokyo and we are enjoying it a lot!

I like everything technology-related like computers, mobile devices, games, VR, blockchain technology, etc.
Apart from that, I like to travel, read, road bike, and sports in general.

Thank you for visiting my personal website. Don't hesitate to say hi!

Jose
