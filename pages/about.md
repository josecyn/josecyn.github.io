<h1 class="mx-auto" style="font-family:Courgette;">{{ page.title }}</h1>

I'm Jose Carlos. I was born in beautiful Barcelona, Spain.

Since early childhood, I always enjoyed finding out how things work, and somehow, I still do it these days.

After finishing university and a few years working I decided to move to Vienna (Austria) with my girlfriend.
I always wanted to live abroad. I had no specific plans. In those 5 years, we had amazing experiences, we met wonderful people and we even had our wedding there! But we decided to move to Japan looking for new challenges.

I always had an interest in Japanese culture. And even more, after traveling two times between 2015 and 2017.
Nowadays, we live in Tokyo and we are enjoying it a lot!

I like everything technology-related like computers, mobile devices, games, VR, blockchain technology, etc.
Apart from that, I like to travel, read, and sports in general.

Thank you for visiting my personal website. 
Don't hesitate to say hi!

Jose
