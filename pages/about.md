Hi there! 

I'm Jose Carlos, a technology enthusiast born in the beautiful city of Barcelona. 

Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by how things work. This curiosity still drives me today in my career and hobbies.

After university, I worked for a few years before my girlfriend and I decided to take a leap and move to Vienna, Austria. Living abroad had always been a dream of mine. Our 5 years in Vienna were incredible - we made lifelong friends, got married, and made memories we'll cherish forever. 

Looking for a new challenge, we moved to Japan for 5 unforgettable years. Now we're thrilled to be back in Vienna, a city we hold dear. 

These days, I enjoy immersing myself in all things tech - computers, programming, mobile tech, VR, blockchain, and more. I'm also an avid traveler who loves exploring new places and cultures. Reading, finance, and sports round out my interests. 

I created this site to showcase my work and connect with new opportunities. 

Thanks so much for stopping by - don't hesitate to say hello!

Jose
