### Hi, I'm Jose Carlos ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer specialized in Deep Learning with more than 10 years of experience.
During all these years, I have developed in Python, Java, PHP, and CPL (proprietary technology). I have designed web, backend, frontend, and scripting solutions for platforms such as mobile devices, desktop, and servers.

All these different projects made me versatile, making me able to face every challenge and adopt new technologies and methodologies to achieve success.
