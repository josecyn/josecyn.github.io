### Hi, I'm Jose Carlos ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer specialized in Deep Learning with more than 10 years of experience.
During all these years, I have developed in different programming languages including Python, Java, PHP, and CPL (proprietary programming language). I have experience with RDB like Oracle. I have designed solutions for different platforms such as mobile devices, smart glasses, embedded systems, and servers using different architectures like web, desktop, backend, frontend, and scripting.

All these different projects made me versatile, making me able to face every challenge and adopt new technologies and methodologies to achieve success.
