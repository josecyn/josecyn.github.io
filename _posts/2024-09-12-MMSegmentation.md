## **Background**
In our ongoing efforts to enhance fruit detection through computer vision, we encountered significant challenges related to identifying fruits against diverse backgrounds. Unrelated objects and environmental noise in the images impaired the accuracy and reliability of the detection algorithms. To address this issue, we adopted orchard segmentation techniques aimed at isolating the orchard area from the background, thereby improving the precision and performance of fruit detection systems.

## **Objective**
Semantic segmentation involves clustering image components that belong to the same object class. This process operates at the pixel level, categorizing each pixel into a specific object class. Our primary objective was to develop an orchard semantic segmentation algorithm that could efficiently differentiate the orchard (canopy) from the surrounding background. This differentiation helps to eliminate the interference of non-relevant objects and enhances the accuracy of the fruit detection pipeline.

## **MMSegmentation Approach**
MMSegmentation is a robust toolbox designed for the unified implementation and evaluation of various semantic segmentation methods. It offers high-quality implementations of popular models and datasets, providing us with the necessary infrastructure to train, test, and run inference models. This tool simplifies the process by focusing on configuring the model, allowing us to concentrate on data preparation, selecting model architecture, and fine-tuning parameters.

### **Data Preparation**
The dataset is structured as follows:

- Mask values: The background is labeled as 0, while the canopy class is assigned a value of 1. If additional classes were involved, they would be labeled as 2, 3, 4, and so on.


If the dataset directory structure is organized as below, 
the load_data_list can parse dataset directory Structure:


```plaintext
├── data
│ ├── my_dataset
│ │ ├── img_dir
│ │ │ ├── train
│ │ │ │ ├── xxx{img_suffix}
│ │ │ │ ├── yyy{img_suffix}
│ │ │ ├── val
│ │ │ │ ├── zzz{img_suffix}
│ │ ├── ann_dir
│ │ │ ├── train
│ │ │ │ ├── xxx{seg_map_suffix}
│ │ │ │ ├── yyy{seg_map_suffix}
│ │ │ ├── val
│ │ │ │ ├── zzz{seg_map_suffix}
```

### **Model Architecture**
We chose the Segmenter architecture, which is based on Vision Transformers (ViT). Segmenter has shown state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation. It processes images efficiently, performing segmentation on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU within 0.2 seconds per image (input size: 640x640 pixels).

### **Training Parameters**
The following training parameters were configured for optimal results:
- **Iterations:** 2000
- **Validation interval:** 10,000 iterations
- **Logging interval:** 50 iterations
- **Checkpoint interval:** 500 iterations
- **Image size:** 1920x1920 pixels (resized)
- **Crop size:** 640x640 pixels
- **Number of classes:** 2 (background and canopy)
- **Dataset type:** 'BaseSegDataset'
- **Data root:** 'data/patches/'
- **Segmentation map suffix:** '_canopy.png'
- **Random flip probability:** 0.5
- **Batch sizes:** Train (2), Validation (2), Test (1)
- **Workers:** Train (2), Validation (2), Test (2)
- **Optimizer:** SGD with learning rate 0.001, momentum 0.9, and no weight decay
- **Work directory:** 'work_dir/'

Training was executed using the provided `train.py` script from MMSegmentation.

## **Results**
The results were significant, with marked improvements in accuracy over our previous model, DeepLabV3+. The Segmenter architecture efficiently handled semantic segmentation, processing each image in 0.2 seconds and demonstrating a higher level of precision in isolating orchard canopies.

## **Conclusion**
Our exploration into the application of MMSegmentation for orchard identification yielded positive results. By leveraging the Segmenter architecture powered by Vision Transformers, we achieved efficient and accurate canopy segmentation, which, in turn, improved the reliability of our fruit detection systems. This approach outperformed our previous DeepLabV3+ model and confirmed the value of advanced semantic segmentation methods in agricultural computer vision.
