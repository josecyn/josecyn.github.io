# Canopy Segmentation Using Detectron2

## Background
In efforts to advance fruit detection through computer vision, a major challenge emerged: identifying and isolating fruits against a complex background. Unrelated objects and backgrounds negatively impacted the accuracy of our fruit detection algorithms. To overcome this issue, we focused on orchard segmentation techniques, aiming to distinguish the orchard canopy from the background, thereby improving both precision and efficiency.

## Objective
The primary goal was to develop an orchard segmentation algorithm capable of accurately distinguishing the orchard area from surrounding elements. By doing so, we intended to reduce interference from irrelevant objects and enhance the reliability of fruit detection systems.

## Approach Using Detectron2
We employed the Detectron2 repository to implement an orchard segmentation model. Below is a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Custom Dataset Reader**: A custom dataset reader was created to handle the orchard segmentation dataset, ensuring proper loading for both training and evaluation.

2. **Dataset Registration**: The dataset was registered within Detectron2 by specifying necessary metadata, allowing access during training and evaluation.

3. **Training**: The orchard segmentation model was trained using the following command:
   ```
   python train.py output_dir/exp10/ COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml
   ```
   The model architecture used was `mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x`, a commonly adopted framework for instance segmentation.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, model performance was evaluated using:
   ```
   python test.py output_dir/exp7/model_0000999.pth COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml mix_test
   ```
   This script evaluated the model by processing a trained checkpoint and using the same configuration as during training.

## Challenges
One significant issue encountered was the lack of accuracy at the level of the leaves. Despite experimenting with different input resolutions (from 1024x1024 px to 1800x1800 px), no significant improvement in segmentation precision was achieved.

## Segmentation Mask Refinement with DeepLabV3+
To improve the segmentation results, we incorporated the DeepLabV3+ model into the process. The goal was to refine the edges of the segmentation masks produced by Detectron2. 

1. **Initial Detectron2 Segmentation**: The orchard area was initially segmented using the Detectron2 model.
  
2. **Refinement with DeepLabV3+**: We applied DeepLabV3+ to refine the edges of the segmentation mask, aiming for more precise delineation of the canopy edges.

3. **Fruit Detection**: The fruit detection model was run on the refined segmentation areas.

Visual representations of this process illustrate the Detectron2 mask in yellow, while detections from this experiment are highlighted in red. The legacy model's detections and user-defined regions of interest (ROI) are marked in blue.

## Conclusion
Despite incorporating the DeepLabV3+ refinement step, the results were not satisfactory for our purposes. The refined segmentation model failed to provide precise separation between adjacent trees, leading to suboptimal fruit detection outcomes. Although the new approach eliminated the need for manual ROI selection, it did not deliver the desired level of accuracy.

This exploration underscores the complexity of orchard segmentation and the need for further research to identify more effective approaches for accurate segmentation and fruit detection in orchard environments.
