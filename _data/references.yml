  Testimonial: |-
    Mr. Jose Carlos Yanez Nieto, BSc., Born on February 25, 1987, was from 1. November 2012 to May 31th 2018 in the R&D HCIS Medical Documentation department as a software developer in our company.

    [Agfa HealthCare](https://global.agfahealthcare.com/), a company of the [Agfa-Gevaert Group](https://www.agfa.com/corporate/), is a leading provider of IT-supported clinical workflow and diagnostic image management solutions as well as modern systems for image acquisition and image processing in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Agfa HealthCare has more than a century of diagnostic imaging experience and has pioneered the healthcare IT market since the early 1990s. The HealthCare Division has branches and agencies in more than 100 countries worldwide.

    Mr. Yanez Nieto was responsible for the decisive contribution to the design of the appointment management product in the ORBIS hospital information system. Functionalities developed exclusively by Mr. Yanez Nieto:
    * Connection of the appointment planning to MS Outlook
    * Appointment notification via email / SMS
    * Automatic appointment reminder
    * iCalendar feeds


    This included both the product design and the implementation in the following technologies: JAVA (J2EE, JMS, Web Services, XML, XSL ....), PL / SQL as well as the in-house development tools.

    Mr. Yanez Nieto has excellent and in-depth specialist knowledge, which he has always brought to our company in a highly profitable manner. We would particularly like to highlight his astonishing general knowledge of the entire product range and the rapid learning of the German language so that he achieved a remarkable level of language confidence within a short period of time. Much to the benefit of our company, he always expanded and updated his extensive specialist knowledge with great success through regular participation in further training events.

    Due to his very good perception, he was always able to accurately grasp even difficult situations immediately and to find very good solutions quickly. He showed a sense of responsibility that went beyond the normal range. Mr. Yanez Nieto also showed a high level of initiative at all times and always fully identified himself with his tasks and our company, which he also took with great enthusiasm.

    Even in situations with the greatest workload, he always proved to be extremely resilient. He carried out all tasks completely independently at all times, extremely careful and well thought out. He always acted calmly, deliberately, goal-oriented, and extremely precise. He was always convincing in a special way, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Mr. Yanez Nieto was particularly reliable. We particularly liked the care and accuracy with which he completed all the tasks assigned to him to the fullest satisfaction.

    The achievements of Mr. Yanez Nieto have found our full recognition at all times and in every respect.

    He was appreciated by everyone because of his always friendly and balanced nature. He was always helpful and courteous and, if necessary, also put personal interests aside. Without exception, his behavior towards superiors, colleagues, and customers was exemplary and loyal.

    Mr. Yanez Nieto is leaving our company on May 31th 2018 at his own request. We regret this very much because with him we are losing a very good employee. We would like to thank him for his consistently very good performance and wish him continued success and all the best for the future, both professionally and privately.
