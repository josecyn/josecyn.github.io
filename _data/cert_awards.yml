  Description: >
    In my previous company, a contest is organized every year to award innovations and new product developments.
    I won the product innovation award for a new feature related with patient notification using e-mail and SMS
    technologies and iCalendar synchronization. 
    To be able to see patient appointments from outside hospital's network in a secure fashion, was a persistent problem and it  
    was solved using iCal synchronization.
    All departments and teams take part into this event.

    Every year, at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia a handful of degree's final projects are rewarded with a special distinction. 
    In 2010 my project was selected as one of the best and therefore rewarded with special distinction.
    The project was about the integration between sensors, a microcontroller, a Bluetooth device and a mobile phone for sending
    and displaying sensor data.
