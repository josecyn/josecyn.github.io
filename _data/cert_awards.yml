    In my previous company, Agfa HealthCare, a contest is organized every year to award innovations and new product developments.
    To be able to see patient appointments from outside the hospital's network in a secure way, was a persistent problem and I solved it using iCal synchronization.
    In 2016 I won the Laureate for Product Technology Innovation Award for a new feature related to patient appointment notification using email/SMS technologies and iCalendar synchronization.

    Every year, at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia a handful of degree's final projects are rewarded with a special distinction.
    In 2010 my project was selected as one of the best and therefore rewarded with a special distinction.
    The project was about the integration between sensors, a microcontroller, a Bluetooth device, and a mobile phone for sending and displaying sensor data.
